## 📝 Addressing Your Git Sync Issue

You mentioned being 94 commits behind with local changes. Here's how to resolve:

### Understanding the Problem
- Your local `main` is at commit `f6c738e`
- Remote `origin/main` is at commit `ff41caf` (94 commits ahead)
- You have uncommitted changes that conflict with remote

### Solution: Safe Merge (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Step 1: Save your work
git stash push -m "My local changes before sync"

# Step 2: Update to latest
git pull origin main

# Step 3: Restore your changes
git stash pop

# Step 4: If conflicts occur, resolve them
# Git will mark conflicts in files
# Edit files, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Merged remote changes with my work"

# Step 5: Push if needed
git push origin main
```

### Alternative: Start Fresh (if you don't need local changes)

```bash
# CAUTION: This discards all local changes!
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Now you're in sync with remote
```

### Alternative: Keep Both Versions

```bash
# Create a branch for your work
git checkout -b my-local-work
git add .
git commit -m "My local changes"

# Switch back and update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Your work is safe in my-local-work branch
# Merge when ready:
git merge my-local-work
```

**My Recommendation**: Use the first solution (stash, pull, pop) to keep your work safe.

## 💬 Questions I Can Answer

### "Can you build the lead form for me?"
Yes! See QUICK-ACTIONS.md Section 6 for complete code.

### "What should I prioritize?"
Deploy → Monitor → Lead Form → Lead List → Dashboard

### "How much will ML cost?"
$16K-32K for full implementation, or ~160-320 hours of dev time

### "Can I do this incrementally?"
Absolutely! That's the whole design. Each piece works independently.

### "What about Steve AI?"
The orchestration layer is architected but not built. Budget 200-400 hours.
