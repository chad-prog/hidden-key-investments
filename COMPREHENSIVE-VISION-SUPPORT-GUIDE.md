**Q: What if I want to customize features?**  
A: Everything is built to be customizable. Components are modular and well-documented.

**Q: Can we change direction mid-project?**  
A: Yes! We can adjust priorities at any weekly checkpoint.

### Timeline Questions

**Q: Can we accelerate the timeline?**  
A: Possibly, but quality may be impacted. I recommend the planned timelines for best results.

**Q: What if we need to pause?**  
A: No problem. We can pause and resume at any point. Work is committed regularly.

**Q: Can we do phases out of order?**  
A: Some phases have dependencies (e.g., Phase 4 ML needs Phase 3 data). But many components can be reordered.

### Resource Questions

**Q: Do we need all the API services?**  
A: No. Start with free tiers and upgrade as needed. Many services have generous free tiers.

**Q: What if an API is too expensive?**  
A: We can find alternatives or build custom solutions. I'll always provide cost-effective options.
