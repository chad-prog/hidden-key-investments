# Zero-Config Deployment Guide

## Method 1: GitHub + Netlify (Recommended)
1. Go to https://github.com and create account if needed
2. Create new repository called "hiddenkeyinvestments"
3. Upload all your project files using the web interface
4. Go to https://netlify.com
5. Connect your GitHub repository
6. Netlify will automatically build and deploy

## Method 2: Direct File Upload to Netlify
1. Zip your entire project folder
2. Go to https://netlify.com
3. Drag and drop the zip file
4. Netlify handles the build automatically

## Method 3: Use Git Commands (if Git is available)
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Hidden Key Investments platform"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hiddenkeyinvestments.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## What Netlify Will Do Automatically
- Detect Vite configuration
- Install all dependencies (npm install)
- Build the project (npm run build)
- Deploy to production URL

## No Local Setup Required!
Netlify's build servers have Node.js and npm pre-installed, so you don't need them on your local machine.
