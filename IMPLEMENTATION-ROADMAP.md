## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Sequential (Safest)
Complete each phase fully before moving to the next. Best for small teams or limited resources.

**Timeline**: 24-30 weeks  
**Team**: 1-2 developers  
**Risk**: Low

### Option 2: Parallel (Faster)
Work on multiple phases simultaneously with different team members.

**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks  
**Team**: 3-4 developers  
**Risk**: Medium

### Option 3: Hybrid (Balanced) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
Focus on high-ROI items first, then parallelize later phases.

**Weeks 1-2**: Phase 1 (complete infrastructure) - 1 developer  
**Weeks 3-6**: Phase 2 (MVP UI) - 2 developers  
**Weeks 7-12**: Phase 2 completion + Phase 3 start - 2-3 developers  
**Weeks 13-20**: Phases 3, 4, 5 in parallel - 3-4 developers  
**Weeks 21-24**: Phases 6, 7 completion - 2-3 developers

**Timeline**: 16-20 weeks  
**Team**: 2-4 developers  
**Risk**: Medium-Low
