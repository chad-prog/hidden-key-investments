## 🎯 Key Recommendations

### Recommended Path: B (MVP Sprint)

**Rationale**:
1. **Fastest to revenue** (8 weeks vs. typical 6 months)
2. **Lowest risk** ($20K vs. $97K upfront)
3. **Validates business model** before full investment
4. **Self-funding** - customer revenue funds later phases
5. **Builds momentum** with visible progress

### Why Not Path A?
- Only completes infrastructure (5% remaining)
- Doesn't generate revenue
- No user-facing features
- Good first step, but not standalone

### Why Not Path C?
- Higher upfront investment ($97K)
- Longer time to revenue (24-32 weeks)
- More risk without validation
- Better to validate with MVP first

### Path B Then C
- **Best approach**: Start with Path B
- Validate with 5-10 customers
- Generate revenue to fund Phase 3-6
- Build toward full vision incrementally
- Lower risk, faster validation
