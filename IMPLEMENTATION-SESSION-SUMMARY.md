## Integration Points

### Backend APIs
- `/.netlify/functions/lead-ingest-enhanced` (GET, POST, PATCH)
  - List all leads
  - Create new lead
  - Update lead
  - Get lead by ID

### Data Models
- `src/lib/schemas/crm.ts`
  - LeadSchema (complete type definitions)
  - LeadCreateSchema (creation validation)
  - LeadUpdateSchema (update validation)

### Mock Data
- `src/lib/testFixtures.ts`
  - createMockLead() - Generate realistic test data
  - Demo mode support

## Demo Mode

**Why It Matters**: 
- ✅ Zero configuration required
- ✅ Instant development environment
- ✅ Perfect for demos and testing
- ✅ No API keys needed
- ✅ Realistic mock data

**How It Works**:
```typescript
if (isDemoMode()) {
  // Generate mock leads
  const mockLeads = Array.from({ length: 15 }, createMockLead);
  setLeads(mockLeads);
} else {
  // Real API call
  const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/lead-ingest-enhanced');
  setLeads(await response.json());
}
```

## How to Use

### Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# 2. Start development server
npm run dev

# 3. Open browser
open http://localhost:5173/crm/leads

# That's it! Demo mode loads automatically with mock data.
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Build for production
npm run build
```
