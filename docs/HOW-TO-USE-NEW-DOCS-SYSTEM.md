## 🗂️ New Folder Structure

We created organized folders in `docs/` for better categorization:

```
docs/
├── 00-START-HERE/          # Entry points (move quick start docs here)
├── 01-GETTING-STARTED/     # Setup guides (move setup docs here)
├── 02-ARCHITECTURE/        # Design docs (move architecture docs here)
├── 03-FEATURES/            # Feature docs (move capability docs here)
├── 04-DEVELOPMENT/         # Dev guides (move testing docs here)
├── 05-DEPLOYMENT/          # Deployment (move deployment docs here)
├── 06-VISION-ROADMAP/      # Planning (move roadmap docs here)
├── 07-REFERENCE/           # Quick refs (move reference docs here)
└── archive/                # Old docs (move outdated docs here)
```

**Each folder has a README.md** explaining:
- What belongs in that category
- Recommended reading order
- Estimated time commitment

**Note:** Files haven't been moved yet - this provides the structure when you're ready to organize further.
