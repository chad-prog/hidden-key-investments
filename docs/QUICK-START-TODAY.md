## üéØ Choose Your Path

### Path 1: Complete Infrastructure (45 minutes) ‚ö° RECOMMENDED
**Best for**: Getting to 100% infrastructure complete  
**Impact**: Production-ready platform with full observability

### Path 2: Start Building Features (3 hours) üöÄ
**Best for**: Seeing visible progress quickly  
**Impact**: Working Lead Management UI

### Path 3: Do Both (4 hours) üí™
**Best for**: Maximum progress in one session  
**Impact**: Complete infrastructure + First MVP feature

---

## Path 1: Complete Infrastructure (45 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Sentry Error Tracking (15 minutes)

1. **Create Sentry Account** (5 min)
   ```
   Visit: https://sentry.io/signup/
   Create organization: "Hidden Key Investments"
   Create project: "hidden-key-investments-web"
   Platform: React
   ```

2. **Get Your DSN** (2 min)
   ```
   Copy from: Settings ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí hidden-key-investments-web ‚Üí Client Keys (DSN)
   Format: https://xxxxxxxxxxxxx@oxxxxxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxxxxxx
   ```

3. **Add to Netlify** (5 min)
   ```
   1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
   2. Select your site
   3. Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   4. Add variables:
      - VITE_SENTRY_DSN = <your_dsn>
      - VITE_APP_VERSION = 1.0.0
      - VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT = production
   5. Scopes: Production (or all contexts)
   ```

4. **Deploy** (3 min)
   ```
   Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy ‚Üí Clear cache and deploy site
   ```

‚úÖ **Done!** Sentry is now capturing errors. The code is already integrated in `src/main.tsx`.

### Step 2: Set Up Staging Environment (30 minutes)

1. **Create Staging Branch** (5 min)
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/hidden-key-investments
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b staging
   git push -u origin staging
   ```

2. **Enable in Netlify** (10 min)
   ```
   1. Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your site
   2. Site settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Continuous Deployment
   3. Branch deploys ‚Üí "Let me add individual branches"
   4. Add: staging
   5. Save
   ```

3. **Configure Staging Environment** (Already done!)
   ```
   Your netlify.toml already has:
   [context.staging]
     environment = { NODE_ENV = "staging" }
   ```

4. **Optional: Separate Staging Database** (15 min)
   ```
   Option A: Use same database with staging_ prefix
   Option B: Create separate Supabase project for staging
   
   If Option B:
   1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   2. Create new project: "hidden-key-staging"
   3. Copy connection details
   4. Add to Netlify staging environment variables
   ```

5. **Test Staging Deploy** (5 min)
   ```bash
   # Make a test change
   echo "# Staging test" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: Trigger staging deploy"
   git push
   
   # Check Netlify dashboard for staging deploy
   # URL will be: https://staging--your-site.netlify.app
   ```

‚úÖ **Done!** You now have a staging environment for safe testing.

### Result: 100% Infrastructure Complete! üéâ

**Validation**:
```bash
bash scripts/validate-infrastructure.sh
# Should show: üìà Infrastructure Completion: 100%
```

---

## Path 2: Start Building Features (3 hours)

### Build Lead Management UI

1. **Copy Implementation Code** (30 min)
   ```bash
   # Open docs/PHASE-2-IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILED.md
   # Copy the LeadList.tsx component
   # Create file: src/pages/LeadList.tsx
   # Paste and adjust imports
   ```

2. **Update Routing** (15 min)
   ```typescript
   // In src/App.tsx or your router config
   import LeadList from './pages/LeadList';
   
   // Add route:
   <Route path="/leads" element={<LeadList />} />
   ```

3. **Test Locally** (15 min)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to http://localhost:5173/leads
   # Test the UI (will use demo data initially)
   ```

4. **Connect to API** (30 min)
   ```bash
   # The API is already implemented!
   # File: netlify/functions/lead-ingest-enhanced.js
   
   # Test API:
   curl http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/lead-ingest-enhanced
   
   # If API needs updates, they're already done
   # Just ensure it's returning the right format
   ```

5. **Add Lead Detail View** (60 min)
   ```bash
   # Copy implementation from docs/PHASE-2-IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILED.md
   # Create: src/pages/LeadDetail.tsx
   # Add route: <Route path="/leads/:id" element={<LeadDetail />} />
   # Test the flow: List ‚Üí Detail ‚Üí Edit
   ```

6. **Deploy to Staging** (30 min)
   ```bash
   git add src/pages/LeadList.tsx src/pages/LeadDetail.tsx
   git commit -m "feat: Add Lead Management UI"
   git push
   
   # Check deployment on staging
   ```

‚úÖ **Done!** You have a working Lead Management interface!

**What You Can Do**:
- View all leads
- Search and filter leads
- Sort by name, value, date
- Click to see lead details
- Navigate between list and detail views

---

## Path 3: Do Both (4 hours)

Complete Path 1 first (45 min), then Path 2 (3 hours).

**Result**: 
- ‚úÖ 100% Infrastructure Complete
- ‚úÖ Working Lead Management UI
- ‚úÖ Staging Environment Operational
- ‚úÖ Production Error Tracking Active
