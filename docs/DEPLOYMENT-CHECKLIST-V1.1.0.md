## Deployment Steps

### 1. Staging Deployment (Test First)

```bash
# 1. Merge to staging branch
git checkout staging
git merge copilot/build-lead-capture-integration
git push origin staging

# 2. Verify staging deployment
# Check: https://staging--your-site.netlify.app

# 3. Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://staging--your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/webhook-inbound \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "webhook_source": "staging_test"
  }'

# 4. Verify lead created in staging database
```

**Staging Checklist:**
- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] Webhook endpoint responds (200 OK)
- [ ] Lead appears in staging database
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Security scans pass
- [ ] No errors in Netlify logs

### 2. Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Create production release
git checkout main
git merge staging
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0: Webhook integration and enhanced CI/CD"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.1.0

# 2. Monitor deployment
# Netlify will auto-deploy from main branch
# Watch: https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site/deploys
```

**Production Verification:**
- [ ] Deployment completes successfully
- [ ] Application loads on production URL
- [ ] Test webhook with signature verification
- [ ] Monitor error rates for 30 minutes
- [ ] Check database for test lead
- [ ] Verify all CI/CD jobs pass

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing

#### Test 1: Webhook without signature
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/webhook-inbound \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "production-test@example.com",
    "first_name": "Production",
    "last_name": "Test",
    "webhook_source": "manual_test"
  }'

# Expected: 200 OK (signature optional if WEBHOOK_SECRET not set)
```

#### Test 2: Webhook with signature
```bash
SECRET="your-webhook-secret"
PAYLOAD='{"email":"secure-test@example.com","first_name":"Secure","webhook_source":"signed_test"}'
SIGNATURE=$(echo -n "$PAYLOAD" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$SECRET" | sed 's/^.* //')

curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/webhook-inbound \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Signature: $SIGNATURE" \
  -d "$PAYLOAD"

# Expected: 200 OK
```

#### Test 3: Invalid signature
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/webhook-inbound \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Signature: invalid-signature" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (if WEBHOOK_SECRET is set)
```

#### Test 4: Rate limiting
```bash
# Send 101 requests rapidly
for i in {1..101}; do
  curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/webhook-inbound \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"email\":\"test${i}@example.com\",\"webhook_source\":\"rate_limit_test\"}" &
done
wait

# Expected: Some requests return 429 (rate limited)
```

## Integration Setup

### Third-Party Webhook Integrations

#### Zapier Integration
1. [ ] Create Zapier account (if needed)
2. [ ] Set up webhook action pointing to production URL
3. [ ] Test with sample data
4. [ ] Monitor first 10 submissions
5. [ ] Document Zap configuration

#### Make (Integromat) Integration
1. [ ] Configure HTTP module
2. [ ] Test with sample scenario
3. [ ] Enable scenario
4. [ ] Monitor executions

#### Custom Integrations
1. [ ] Share webhook documentation with integration partners
2. [ ] Provide WEBHOOK_SECRET securely (if needed)
3. [ ] Test integration in sandbox
4. [ ] Monitor production submissions

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Immediate (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Check error rates every hour
- [ ] Monitor webhook success rate
- [ ] Review Netlify function logs
- [ ] Check database for lead creation
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipelines working

### Setup Alerts (if using Sentry)
```javascript
// Configure in src/main.tsx
Sentry.init({
  dsn: import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: 'production',
  release: '1.1.0',
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Alert on critical errors
    if (event.level === 'error') {
      // Configure alerts in Sentry dashboard
    }
    return event;
  }
});
```

### Metrics to Watch
- [ ] Webhook endpoint response time (<200ms p95)
- [ ] Webhook success rate (>95%)
- [ ] Lead ingestion rate
- [ ] Error rate (<0.1%)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline success rate

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Detected

#### Minor Issues (non-critical)
- Monitor and fix in next deployment
- Document in issue tracker

#### Critical Issues (affecting core functionality)

1. **Immediate rollback:**
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or deploy previous release
git checkout v1.0.0
git push origin main -f  # Force push (use carefully!)
```

2. **Netlify Dashboard rollback:**
   - Go to Deploys → Find previous successful deploy
   - Click "..." → "Publish deploy"

3. **Verify rollback:**
   - [ ] Application works
   - [ ] Previous features functional
   - [ ] No new errors

4. **Post-rollback:**
   - [ ] Notify team
   - [ ] Investigate issue
   - [ ] Plan fix deployment
