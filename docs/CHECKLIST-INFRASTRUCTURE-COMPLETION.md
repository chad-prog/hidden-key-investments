## üìã Final Configuration Tasks (Manual - 45 min)

These require configuration in external dashboards (Netlify, Sentry, Supabase):

### ‚òê Task 1: Enable Production Error Tracking (15 min)

**Why**: Know about issues before users complain  
**Priority**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Highest ROI)

**Steps**:
1. Create free Sentry account: [sentry.io/signup](https://sentry.io/signup/)
2. Select "React" platform
3. Copy your DSN (looks like: `https://xxx@sentry.io/xxx`)
4. Add to Netlify:
   - Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Select your site
   - Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - Add: `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` = `your-dsn-here`
   - Scope: Production (or all contexts)
5. Trigger redeploy: Deploys tab ‚Üí Trigger deploy ‚Üí Clear cache and deploy site
6. Test: Visit site, open console, run `throw new Error("Test")`, check Sentry

**Detailed Guide**: [docs/COMPLETE-INFRASTRUCTURE-GUIDE.md](./COMPLETE-INFRASTRUCTURE-GUIDE.md) Section "Task 1"

**Outcome**: ‚úÖ Real-time error tracking in production

---

### ‚òê Task 2: Set Up Staging Environment (30 min)

**Why**: Test changes safely before production  
**Priority**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Essential for team)

**Quick Option (30 min)**:
1. Create staging branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b staging
   git push -u origin staging
   ```

2. Enable in Netlify:
   - [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com) ‚Üí Your site
   - Site settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Continuous Deployment
   - Branch deploys ‚Üí "Let me add individual branches"
   - Add: `staging`
   - Save

3. Your `netlify.toml` already has staging config! ‚úÖ

4. Optional: Create separate staging database in Supabase
   - Or use same database with `staging_` prefix

5. Test:
   ```bash
   echo "# Staging test" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: Trigger staging deploy"
   git push
   ```
   - Visit: `https://staging--[your-site-name].netlify.app`
   - (Replace [your-site-name] with your actual Netlify site name)

**Detailed Guide**: [docs/COMPLETE-INFRASTRUCTURE-GUIDE.md](./COMPLETE-INFRASTRUCTURE-GUIDE.md) Section "Task 2"

**Outcome**: ‚úÖ Safe testing environment before production

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start development
npm run dev

# 2. Make changes, then verify
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build

# 3. Or run all checks
bash scripts/dev-utils.sh pre-commit
```

### Before Pushing to Production
```bash
# 1. Run full validation
bash scripts/validate-infrastructure.sh

# 2. Deploy to staging first
git push origin staging

# 3. Test in staging
# Visit: https://staging--your-site.netlify.app

# 4. If all good, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push
```

### Keep Infrastructure Healthy
```bash
# Weekly health check
bash scripts/check-platform-status.sh

# Check for security updates
npm audit

# Update dependencies (carefully)
npm update
npm run test  # Verify nothing breaks
```

---

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### Validation Script Shows <100%
1. Read the specific check that failed
2. Follow the guidance provided
3. Re-run after fixing: `bash scripts/validate-infrastructure.sh`

### Tests Failing
```bash
# Run with details
npm run test

# For specific test
npm run test -- LeadList.test

# Check functions
npm run test:functions
```

### Build Failing
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Sentry Not Working
1. Verify DSN is correct in Netlify
2. Check you redeployed after adding variable
3. Test with: `throw new Error("Test")` in browser console
4. Check Sentry project is active

### Staging Not Deploying
1. Check branch deploys are enabled in Netlify
2. Verify branch name is exactly `staging`
3. Check build logs for errors
4. Manually trigger: Netlify ‚Üí Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy
