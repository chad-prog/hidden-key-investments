6. **Document** (create incident report)

### Data Loss Incident
1. **Stop writes** (prevent further damage)
2. **Assess scope** (what data affected?)
3. **Restore from backup** (most recent clean backup)
4. **Verify integrity** (check restored data)
5. **Resume operations** (enable writes)
6. **Post-mortem** (prevent recurrence)

### Security Incident
1. **Contain** (isolate affected systems)
2. **Assess** (scope of breach)
3. **Eradicate** (remove threat)
4. **Recover** (restore services)
5. **Notify** (affected users, authorities if required)
6. **Post-incident review** (improve security)
