**CI Pipeline Jobs**:
1. **Security Scan** (~2 min)
   - Trivy: File system vulnerability scanning
   - Gitleaks: Secret detection
   - TruffleHog: Secret verification
   - Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

2. **Lint** (~1 min)
   - ESLint with TypeScript, React, and React Hooks rules
   - npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
   - Environment validation script
   - **Status**: 0 errors, 210 warnings (all non-critical)

3. **Test** (~2 min)
   - Unit tests with coverage (19 tests)
   - Integration tests for serverless functions (82 tests)
   - Coverage reporting to Codecov
   - Test artifacts uploaded (7-day retention)

4. **Build** (~1 min)
   - Production build verification
   - Environment configuration validation
   - Build artifacts uploaded (7-day retention)

5. **Deploy Preview** (PRs only)
   - Automatic Netlify deploy preview
   - PR comment with deployment status
   - Preview URL provided by Netlify

### 2. Staging Environment ✅

**What Was Done**:
- Documented complete staging setup process
- Configured Netlify branch deploy contexts
- Provided isolated database setup instructions (Supabase)
- Created staging workflow documentation

**Configuration Ready**:
```toml
# Production context
[context.production]
  environment = { NODE_ENV = "production" }

# Staging context
[context.staging]
  environment = { NODE_ENV = "staging" }

# Branch deploy context
[context.branch-deploy]
  environment = { NODE_ENV = "development" }

# Deploy Preview context
[context.deploy-preview]
  environment = { NODE_ENV = "preview" }
```

**Deployment URLs**:
- Production: `hidden-key-investments.netlify.app`
- Staging: `staging--hidden-key-investments.netlify.app`
- Branch: `[branch]--hidden-key-investments.netlify.app`
- PR Preview: `deploy-preview-[pr]--hidden-key-investments.netlify.app`

### 3. Secret/ENV Management ✅

**What Was Done**:
- Created comprehensive ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md guide
- Documented all required and optional environment variables
- Provided security best practices
- Clarified client-side vs server-side variable naming
- Included Netlify and GitHub Secrets configuration

**Environment Variables Documented**:

| Category | Variables | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Core | `NODE_ENV`, `VITE_APP_VERSION`, `CONTEXT` | ✅ Documented |
| Database | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ✅ Documented |
| Error Tracking | `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` | ✅ Documented |
| Email Marketing | `MAILCHIMP_*`, `VITE_MAILCHIMP_*` | ✅ Documented |
| Data Sync | `AIRTABLE_*`, `VITE_AIRTABLE_*` | ✅ Documented |

**Key Distinction**:
- `VITE_*` prefix: Client-side variables (embedded in browser bundle)
- No prefix: Server-side variables (serverless functions only)

**Security Features**:
- Demo mode when API keys not configured
- Environment-specific configuration
- Secrets isolated in Netlify/GitHub
- Validation scripts provided
- Health check endpoint for verification
