## 💡 FAQ

### Q: Do I need to build everything in order?
**A**: No! You can:
- Skip directly to features you need most
- Run multiple phases in parallel (if team allows)
- Iterate based on user feedback
- Adjust priorities as business needs change

### Q: Can we change paths mid-implementation?
**A**: Absolutely! The paths are flexible:
- Start with Path A, upgrade to B later
- Build Path B, add Path C features as needed
- Mix and match phases based on priorities

### Q: What if I have a smaller team?
**A**: Scale recommendations:
- 1-2 devs: Focus on Path A, take 12-16 weeks
- 3-4 devs: Path B is perfect, 16-20 weeks
- 5+ devs: Can tackle Path C or D

### Q: What about ongoing maintenance?
**A**: After launch:
- 20-40 hours/month for maintenance
- Bug fixes, security updates, minor features
- Plan for 1 dev @ 50% time
- Cost: $5-10K/month fully loaded

### Q: When will we see ROI?
**A**: ROI timeline:
- **Immediate**: Reduced manual work (Phase 2)
- **3 months**: 30% automation, $1-2K/month savings
- **6 months**: 70% automation, $6-8K/month savings
- **12 months**: 95% automation, $30-40K/month savings
- **Break-even**: Typically month 6-8
