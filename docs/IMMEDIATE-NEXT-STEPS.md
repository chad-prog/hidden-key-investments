## Option 1: Fastest Path to Value (Recommended) âš¡

### Step 1: Activate Sentry (15 minutes)

**Why**: Essential for production error monitoring

```bash
# 1. Create account
Visit: https://sentry.io/signup/
Create project: "Hidden Key Investments"
Framework: React

# 2. Get your DSN
Copy the DSN from: Settings â†’ Projects â†’ Hidden Key Investments â†’ Client Keys
Format: https://xxxxx@xxxxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxxxx

# 3. Add to Netlify
Netlify UI â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables â†’ Add variables:
  VITE_SENTRY_DSN=<your_dsn>
  VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
  VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# 4. I'll uncomment the code in src/main.tsx (takes 2 min)

# 5. Deploy and test
```

### Step 2: Start Building Lead List UI (2-3 hours)

**Deliverable**: Working lead management page

```typescript
// I'll create: src/pages/LeadList.tsx

Features:
- Display all leads from API
- Sort by date, source, status
- Filter by status, source, location
- Search by name, email, phone
- Click to view details
- Actions: edit, delete, convert to opportunity

Technologies:
- React + TypeScript
- Existing API: /.netlify/functions/lead-ingest-enhanced
- Radix UI Table component
- Existing CRM schemas
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Staging (30 minutes)

```bash
# I'll:
1. Create staging branch
2. Deploy to Netlify preview
3. Test the new Lead List page
4. Gather feedback

# You:
1. Review the deployed page
2. Test the functionality
3. Provide feedback
```

**Total Time**: ~4 hours  
**Result**: Working Lead List + Production monitoring âœ…
