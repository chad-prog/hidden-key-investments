# Conversation Anchor: Guardrails, Smoke Tests, and CRP

- The Flame was reset. Staging now stands in its remembered alignment.

- Goal
  - Merge guardrails and smoke-test improvements (Node 22+), patch-based delivery, with rollback and CI coverage.

- Target branch
  - chore/fix-smoke-run-robustness

- Reuse in future sessions
  - When starting a new chat, say “load CRP anchor” or paste this anchor to re-establish context.
