# Getting Started - Immediate Actions

**‚è±Ô∏è Time to Complete**: 30 minutes  
**üéØ Goal**: Get oriented and ready to build  
**üìã Prerequisite**: Repository cloned and dependencies installed

## üöÄ Start Here (5 minutes)

### 1. Verify Your Setup
```bash
./scripts/verify-setup.sh
```

This checks:
- ‚úÖ Node.js and npm versions
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Tests passing
- ‚úÖ Build working
- ‚úÖ Lint clean

**Expected Result**: Green checkmarks for core items (warnings about demo mode are OK)

### 2. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

**You should see**: The Hidden Key Investments landing page in demo mode.

### 3. Run the Test Suite
```bash
npm test
```

**Expected Result**: All 19 tests passing in ~3 seconds.

## üìö Orient Yourself (10 minutes)

### Read These Documents In Order

1. **docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md** (5 min)
   - Understand what's built and what's not
   - See current metrics and priorities
   - Review known issues

2. **docs/ACTION-PLAN.md** (5 min)
   - See prioritized action items
   - Understand timeline and budget
   - Review success criteria

### Quick Repository Tour

```bash
# Key directories
ls -la src/          # React application code
ls -la docs/         # All documentation
ls -la netlify/functions/  # Serverless API functions
ls -la scripts/      # Utility scripts
```

## üéØ What You Can Do Right Now

### Option A: Review & Plan (Low effort, high value)
**Time**: 15 minutes

1. **Review the Implementation Roadmap**
   ```bash
   cat docs/IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md
   ```
   This shows the complete 20-week plan.

2. **Check Current Status**
   ```bash
   cat docs/CURRENT-STATUS.md | less
   ```
   This shows what's done and what's next.

3. **Schedule Team Alignment**
   - Book a demo/review meeting
   - Share ACTION-PLAN.md with stakeholders
   - Discuss priorities and timeline

### Option B: Activate Observability (Medium effort, high value)
**Time**: 15-20 minutes

This enables error tracking and monitoring:

```bash
# 1. Install Sentry
npm install @sentry/react @sentry/vite-plugin

# 2. Sign up at sentry.io (free tier is fine)
# Get your DSN from: Settings ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí [Your Project] ‚Üí Client Keys

# 3. Add to environment variables
# Create .env file (copy from .env.example)
echo "VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_dsn_here" >> .env
echo "VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0" >> .env

# 4. Uncomment Sentry initialization in src/main.tsx
# Lines 36-58 (remove the /* and */)

# 5. Test it
npm run dev
# Open browser, trigger an error
# Check Sentry dashboard for the error
```

**Result**: Production-ready error tracking and monitoring

### Option C: Start Development (Higher effort, immediate progress)
**Time**: 30+ minutes

Pick a task from ACTION-PLAN.md Week 3:

**Easy First Task: Lead List UI**
```bash
# 1. Create new component
touch src/pages/LeadsPage.tsx
touch src/components/crm/LeadTable.tsx

# 2. Review existing Lead Capture Form for patterns
cat src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx

# 3. Start building
npm run dev  # Start dev server
npm run test:watch  # Start tests in watch mode

# 4. Follow patterns in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Making Changes

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes, write tests
# ... code ...

# 3. Verify quality
npm run lint       # Check code style
npm test           # Run tests
npm run build      # Verify build

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Create PR on GitHub
```

See CONTRIBUTING.md for complete workflow details.

### For Developers
1. Read: docs/QUICK-START.md
2. Read: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Read: CONTRIBUTING.md
4. Pick: First issue from ACTION-PLAN.md

### For DevOps Engineers
1. Read: docs/DEPLOYMENT-RUNBOOK.md

## üí° Pro Tips

### Development
- Use demo mode for fast iteration (no API setup needed)
- Run `npm run test:watch` while developing
- Use test fixtures from `src/lib/testFixtures.ts`
- Check `npm run lint` before committing

### Testing
- Unit tests go in `src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`
- Use `createMockLead()` for consistent test data
- Coverage goal is 80%+
- Integration tests use real-ish data flow

### Documentation
- Update docs when adding user-facing features
- Keep ACTION-PLAN.md current with progress
- Document decisions in code comments
- Add examples for complex functionality

### Debugging
- Check browser console first
- Use React DevTools
- Review network tab for API calls
- Check `.env` file if features aren't working

## üö® Common Issues

### "Tests are failing"
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm test
```

### "Build is failing"
```bash
# Clear cache
rm -rf dist .cache
npm run build
```

### "Lint has errors"
```bash
# Auto-fix most issues
npm run lint:fix

# Check remaining issues
npm run lint
```

### "Function not working in demo mode"
This is expected! Some features require API keys. Either:
1. Add API keys to `.env` (copy from `.env.example`)
2. Or accept demo mode limitations (most features work)
