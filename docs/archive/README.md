# 📦 Archive

**Historical and superseded documentation**

## Purpose:
This folder contains:
- Outdated documentation that has been replaced
- Historical session summaries
- Superseded implementation guides
- Old versions of documents

These files are kept for historical reference but should not be used for current development.

**⚠️ Use current documentation in the main folders instead**
