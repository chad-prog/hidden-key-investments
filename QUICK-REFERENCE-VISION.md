## üö® Common Questions

**Q: Can we start with WorkflowBuilder instead of InvestorProfile?**
A: Yes! Just let me know which component to prioritize.

**Q: Do we need all the API keys upfront?**
A: No. Phase 2 only needs SendGrid + Twilio. Phase 3+ needs enrichment APIs.

**Q: Can we do Phase 3 before finishing Phase 2?**
A: Not recommended. Phase 2 provides user-facing value and foundation for Phase 3.

**Q: What if we want to customize the roadmap?**
A: Absolutely! Tell me your priorities and I'll adjust the plan.

**Q: Can we skip some phases?**
A: Yes! You can do Phases 2-3 and skip 4-7, or any combination.

**Q: How do we know it's working?**
A: I'll provide demo mode, tests, and weekly demos. You'll see progress constantly.
