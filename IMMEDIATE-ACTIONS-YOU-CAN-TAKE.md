## 🚀 Path 1: Complete Infrastructure (45 minutes)

### What You'll Accomplish
- ✅ Production error monitoring active
- ✅ Staging environment for testing
- ✅ Secret management complete
- ✅ 100% infrastructure completion

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Enable Sentry (15 minutes)

1. **Sign up for Sentry** (5 min)
   - Go to: https://sentry.io/signup/
   - Choose "Developer" plan (FREE)
   - Create a new project: "Hidden Key Investments"
   - Select "React" as platform

2. **Get Your DSN** (2 min)
   - After project creation, copy the DSN
   - It looks like: `https://abc123@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/789012`

3. **Add to Netlify** (5 min)
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Your site → Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add new variable:
     - **Key**: `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`
     - **Value**: Your DSN from step 2
     - **Scopes**: All (Production, Deploy Previews, Branch deploys)
   - Save

4. **Redeploy** (3 min)
   - Trigger redeploy: Site settings → Deploys → Trigger deploy
   - Wait for deployment to complete

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check if Sentry is active
curl -I https://your-site.netlify.app | grep -i sentry
```

#### Step 2: Create Staging Environment (15 minutes)

1. **Create Staging Branch** (2 min)
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/hidden-key-investments
   git checkout -b staging
   git push -u origin staging
   ```

2. **Enable in Netlify** (5 min)
   - Netlify dashboard → Branch deploys
   - Add branch: `staging`
   - Enable "Deploy only these branches"
   - Save

3. **Configure Staging Environment** (5 min)
   - Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add staging-specific variables:
     - **Key**: `NODE_ENV`
     - **Value**: `staging`
     - **Scope**: Branch deploys (staging only)

4. **Test Staging Deploy** (3 min)
   ```bash
   git checkout staging
   git push
   # Watch deploy in Netlify dashboard
   ```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Once deployed, get staging URL from Netlify
bash scripts/validate-staging.sh <staging-url>
```

#### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets (15 minutes)

1. **Add Required Secrets** (10 min)
   - Go to: GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add these secrets:
     - `SENTRY_DSN`: Your Sentry DSN
     - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL (if you have one)
     - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key (if you have one)

2. **Test CI/CD** (5 min)
   - Make a small change to README.md
   - Commit and push
   - Watch GitHub Actions run
   - Verify all checks pass

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions status
gh run list --limit 5
```

### What's Next After Path 1?
- ✅ Infrastructure: 100% complete
- 🎯 Status: Production-ready
- 🚀 Next: Build features (Path 2) or celebrate! 🎉

## 🎨 Path 2: Build First Feature (3-4 hours)

### What You'll Get
- ✅ Complete Lead Management Dashboard
- ✅ Lead list with search, filter, sort
- ✅ Lead detail views with tabs
- ✅ Lead creation forms
- ✅ Status badges and indicators
- ✅ Working demo data

### How This Works

**I'll build**:
- All React components
- All TypeScript types
- All styling with Tailwind
- All state management
- All API integration
- All tests

**You'll do**:
- Tell me "Build the Lead Management Dashboard"
- Test the result
- Give feedback
- Request adjustments

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Tell Me to Start (1 minute)
Just say: **"Build me the Lead Management Dashboard"**

I'll respond with:
- Detailed implementation plan
- Component structure
- Timeline (3-4 hours of my work)

#### Step 2: I Build Everything (3-4 hours)
I'll create:

```typescript
src/pages/LeadManagement.tsx           // Main dashboard
src/components/leads/LeadList.tsx      // List view
src/components/leads/LeadCard.tsx      // Card component
src/components/leads/LeadDetail.tsx    // Detail view
src/components/leads/LeadFilters.tsx   // Filter sidebar
src/components/leads/LeadStats.tsx     // Statistics
src/components/leads/LeadActions.tsx   // Action buttons
```

With features:
- 🔍 Search leads by name, email, property
- 🏷️ Filter by status, source, date range
- 📊 Sort by any column
- 📄 Pagination (10/25/50 per page)
- 👁️ View lead details
- ✏️ Edit lead information
- 🗑️ Archive/delete leads
- 📈 Lead statistics

#### Step 3: You Test (30 minutes)
```bash
# I'll tell you when ready
npm run dev

# Open: http://localhost:5173/leads
```

Test these scenarios:
- [ ] View list of leads
- [ ] Search for a lead
- [ ] Filter by status
- [ ] Sort by date
- [ ] Click to view details
- [ ] Edit a lead
- [ ] Create new lead
- [ ] View statistics

#### Step 4: Feedback & Refinement (30 minutes)
Tell me:
- What works great
- What needs changes
- What's missing
- What to add next

I'll adjust immediately.
